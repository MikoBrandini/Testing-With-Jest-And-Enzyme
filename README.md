## Thinking In React: Testing With Jest And Enzyme
The point of this project is to practice unit testing ReactJS components.<br/>
I am using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as my test runner and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for my assertions. <br />
The components being tested on this project are based on [Thinking In React.](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
